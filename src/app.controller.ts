      <h2>Logging</h2>
      For each request of the web application to its REST-API backend,
      data about this process is stored in a log file. These data are not personally identifiable,
      so we cannot trace which user accessed which data. Therefore,
      no individual user profiles can be created. The stored data is only evaluated for bugtracing purposes.
      In the event of such access, no data is passed on to third parties.
      Log data is overwritten each time the server application is restarted.

      <h2>User data</h2>
      <p>
        During the first loading of this page a UUID v4
        (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt" target="_blank">RFC 4122</a>) is created.
        The UUID is generated using a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator.
        This is necessary to differentiate between the sessions of different users.
      </p>
      <p>
        A session is valid for 7 days. If the website is not reloaded within this time,
        the session is not automatically extended for a further 7 days.
        At the end of this period, the session and all data associated with it,
        such as tasks and their results, will be irrevocably deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Results that were previously evaluated by the user for future AI training and released for scientific use will not be deleted.
        However, these can no longer be accessed by the user after the session has expired,
        as previous session data cannot be linked to the new generated session.
